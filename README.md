# deeplearning_ai
To Expand my Machine learning technical knowledge Â· Taking hands-on training to acquire practical skills from DeepLearning.AI which is an education technology company

WHAT I LEARN
  Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)

  Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods

  Apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection

  Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & build a deep reinforcement learning model
